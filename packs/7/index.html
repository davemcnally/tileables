                <h2>Pack 7: Outdoors</h2>
                <p>I’ve wanted to answer the requests for a nature-based pack for a while and having recently moved the site over to GitHub and updated to use Grunt and Jekyll, what better an opportunity to add in a new pack?! Subtlety is a must with this pack — the textures are very contrasting and shouldn’t be used without filters!</p>
                <p class="priceguide">Downloading the pack is quick and fully automated — you'll receive a download link via email once your Paypal payment is completed so keep an eye on your inbox. You can even choose your own price too, just decide how much you'd like to pay!</p>
