                <h2>Pack 7: Outdoors</h2>
                <p>I’ve wanted to answer the requests for a nature-based pack for a while and having recently moved the site over to GitHub and updated to use Grunt and Jekyll, what better an opportunity to add in a new pack?! Subtlety is a must with this pack — the textures are very contrasting and shouldn’t be used without filters!</p>
