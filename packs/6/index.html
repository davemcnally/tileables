                <h2>Pack 6: Grids</h2>
                <p>One of the most requested pack types I got over email was to create some grids and so here you go! There's 35 individual grid patterns in a variety of sizes, widths and styles. From small 4px squares with a 1px stroke, all the way up to 50px squares with 3px strokes. There's also dotted/dashed styles included for complete customization. These patterns work best when combined with natural textures and at a low opacity.</p>
