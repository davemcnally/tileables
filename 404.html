                <p>It appears that the page you were going to no longer exists, if it used to. Please check the address bar for any possible errors. It could also be that an old page from the previous design was linked to and you followed that here.</p>
                <p>I recommend navigating your way from here to find what you're after â€” I've simplified the site a lot now so it should only take a minute to find what you were after. If you still need help, just let me know and I'll see what I can do.</p>
