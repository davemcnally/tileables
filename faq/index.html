                <p id="a1">1. The packs are indeed free to download. If you want to say thanks, I always appreciate a quick tweet!</p>
                <p id="a2">2. Once you have a pack downloaded and unzipped, you'll see your .PAT file in the download folder. You can get this into Photoshop for use in a couple of ways. Firstly, whilst in Photoshop, open up the Layer Style box on a chosen layer and select Pattern Overlay. From there, you can click the pattern thumbnail in the main panel and then the options cog in the top right — You can Load Patterns and select the .PAT to add them into your current pattern selection or Replace Patterns to replace your current patterns with those chosen .PAT file. Whilst this works, it's not the best way of going about importing. Copying the .PAT file into your preset folder will allow quick, permanent access to those patterns without needing to reopen them. Copy your .PAT and then navigate to your preset folder for patterns. On Mac, it should be something like: <em>/Users/YourName/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop CS6/Presets/Patterns</em> and on Windows, something similar to: <em>C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS6\Presets\Patterns</em>. If you cannot see the folders when navigating Finder or Explorer, it is likely because hidden directories aren't being displayed but if you use Go to Folder in Finder or edit the address bar in Explorer, you'll be able to type those in. Once in the Patterns preset folder, simply paste your .PAT and restart Photoshop if open. When reopening Photoshop and navigating to Pattern Overlays, clicking the pattern thumbnail and option cog this time will show your downloaded pack at the bottom of the list of other patterns — simply click that to load in the chosen pack!</p>
                <p id="a3">3. Within your download, you'll also notice a selection of .PNG files. These should open in just about any image editor you may be using and if that editor supports patterns, such as Sketch does, you can drop your PNG in there are start using the patterns that way. You may not have the same control over filters and blending modes in other applications though!</p>
                <p id="a4">4. When choosing your pattern, you'll see the Blend Mode option in the pattern overlay panel. This is your friend. It will help you blend your pattern with the layer it's being applied to. For example, if you create a blue graphic and then apply a pattern to that layer, choosing a Blend Mode will get you results blended into your blue background. If you're unsure where to start in choosing one, try Overlay and Multiply first — altering the Opacity value as you go. Don't forget the Opacity!</p>
                <p id="a5">5. When redesigning and deciding on selling packs, I cut that pack out as I didn't feel it was of the same high quality of the others and didn't want to charge for it. You can still <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/104273/Tileables-Pack-06.zip">download that pack</a> for free if you want it.</p>
                <p id="a6">6. If there's a pattern or texture type you'd like to me too add, just <a href="mailto:tileables@gmail.com" title="Get In Touch">get in touch</a> and I'll make a note of the request to consider when creating new packs. Sometimes, a certain subject isn't suited to creating a pack from as there may not be enough variation to work with or the patterns may just not tile very well.</p>
                <p id="a7">7. Certainly! If you followed the on-screen instructions and published your tweet, the download is present immediately afterwards. If you still have an issue, please <a href="mailto:tileables@gmail.com" title="Get In Touch">get in touch</a> and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</p>
                <p id="a8">8. The PSD files are no longer included for a couple of reasons. They were not needed given the inclusion of PNG files; the PSD only existed for editing a pattern if needed, before applying and that was only a layered collection of the PNG files anyway so it makes more sense to open a PNG, edit and reapply as required. There was also the file size to take into account and dropping the PSD saved me time and space on my Pulley account! If, for some reason I haven't thought of, you need a PSD to a pack you purchased, let me know and if it makes sense I'll just send one over for you.</p>
